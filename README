Kwiki::PageInclude

After you install this plugin, your are able to use {include: PageName}
wafl phrase in your Kwiki page content, and that will include
 all content of that page in this one. So it allows you to
"modualize" your Kwiki pages. You can give a list of page names
sepearated by comma, or space. They will be included in order.

For example:

  {include: PageOne}

  {include: PageOne,PageTwo}

  {include: PageOne PageTwo}
